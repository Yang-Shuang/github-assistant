# Humanizer

一款适用于 Claude Code 和 OpenCode 的 Skill（技能），用于去除文本中的人工智能生成痕迹，使其读起来更自然、更像人类书写。

## Installation

### Claude Code

直接克隆到 Claude Code 的 Skill 目录：

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
git clone https://github.com/blader/humanizer.git ~/.claude/skills/humanizer
```

如果你已克隆该仓库，也可手动复制技能文件：

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/humanizer
cp SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/humanizer/
```

### OpenCode

直接克隆到 OpenCode 的 Skill 目录：

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/skills
git clone https://github.com/blader/humanizer.git ~/.config/opencode/skills/humanizer
```

如果你已克隆该仓库，也可手动复制技能文件：

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/skills/humanizer
cp SKILL.md ~/.config/opencode/skills/humanizer/
```

> **Note:** OpenCode also scans `~/.claude/skills/` for compatibility, so if you use both tools, a single clone into `~/.claude/skills/humanizer/` is enough.
> > **注意：** OpenCode 也会扫描 `~/.claude/skills/` 目录以保持兼容，因此如果你同时使用这两个工具，只需将仓库克隆到 `~/.claude/skills/humanizer/` 即可。

## Usage

### Claude Code

```
/humanizer

[paste your text here]
```

### OpenCode

```
/humanizer

[paste your text here]
```

或者你也可以直接在任一工具中要求模型进行拟人化处理：

```
Please humanize this text: [your text]
```

### Voice Calibration (文风校准)

为了匹配你的个人写作风格，请提供一段你自己的写作样本：

```
/humanizer

Here's a sample of my writing for voice matching:
[paste 2-3 paragraphs of your own writing]

Now humanize this text:
[paste AI text to humanize]
```

该 Skill 会分析你的句式节奏、用词习惯和个性化表达，并将其应用到重写结果中，而不是生成千篇一律的“干净”文本。

## Overview

本工具基于由 WikiProject AI Cleanup 维护的维基百科指南《[AI 写作特征](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing)》。该综合指南源于对数千个 AI 生成文本实例的观察总结。

该 Skill 还包含一次最终的“明显 AI 生成”审查环节以及第二次重写，以捕捉初稿中残留的 AI 写作习惯。

### Key Insight from Wikipedia (来自维基百科的关键洞察)

> "LLMs use statistical algorithms to guess what should come next. The result tends toward the most statistically likely result that applies to the widest variety of cases."
> > “大语言模型使用统计算法来猜测接下来应该出现什么内容。其结果往往倾向于最符合统计学概率、且能适用于最广泛场景的选项。”

## Full Example (完整示例)

**Before (AI-sounding):** (修改前（带有 AI 味）：)
> Great question! Here is an essay on this topic. I hope this helps!
>
> AI-assisted coding serves as an enduring testament to the transformative potential of large language models, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of software development. In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, these groundbreaking tools—nestled at the intersection of research and practice—are reshaping how engineers ideate, iterate, and deliver, underscoring their vital role in modern workflows.
>
> At its core, the value proposition is clear: streamlining processes, enhancing collaboration, and fostering alignment. It's not just about autocomplete; it's about unlocking creativity at scale, ensuring that organizations can remain agile while delivering seamless, intuitive, and powerful experiences to users. The tool serves as a catalyst. The assistant functions as a partner. The system stands as a foundation for innovation.
>
> Industry observers have noted that adoption has accelerated from hobbyist experiments to enterprise-wide rollouts, from solo developers to cross-functional teams. The technology has been featured in The New York Times, Wired, and The Verge. Additionally, the ability to generate documentation, tests, and refactors showcases how AI can contribute to better outcomes, highlighting the intricate interplay between automation and human judgment.
>
> - 💡 **Speed:** Code generation is significantly faster, reducing friction and empowering developers.
> - 🚀 **Quality:** Output quality has been enhanced through improved training, contributing to higher standards.
> - ✅ **Adoption:** Usage continues to grow, reflecting broader industry trends.
>
> While specific details are limited based on available information, it could potentially be argued that these tools might have some positive effect. Despite challenges typical of emerging technologies—including hallucinations, bias, and accountability—the ecosystem continues to thrive. In order to fully realize this potential, teams must align with best practices.
>
> In conclusion, the future looks bright. Exciting times lie ahead as we continue this journey toward excellence. Let me know if you’d like me to expand on any section!

**After (Humanized):** (修改后（拟人化）：)
> AI coding assistants can speed up the boring parts of the job. They're great at boilerplate: config files and the little glue code you don't want to write. They can also help you sketch a test, but you still have to read it.
>
> The dangerous part is how confident the suggestions look. I've accepted code that compiled and passed lint, then discovered later it missed the point because I stopped paying attention.
>
> If you treat it like autocomplete and review every line, it's useful. If you use it to avoid thinking, it will help you ship bugs faster.
>
> The only real backstop is tests. Without them, you're mostly judging vibes.
