# Nanocoder

Built by the [Nano Collective](https://nanocollective.org) — a community collective building AI tooling not for profit, but for the community.

Nanocoder brings agentic coding tools like Claude Code and Gemini CLI to the model of your choice — local models via Ollama, or any OpenAI-compatible API such as OpenRouter, Anthropic, and Google. You decide which provider runs your code and where your data goes. Every tool the collective ships aims to be **privacy-respecting**, **local-first**, and **open for all**: no closed-source features, no paid tiers gating the useful parts.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install -g @nanocollective/nanocoder
nanocoder
```

Also available via [Homebrew](docs/getting-started/installation.md#homebrew-macoslinux) and [Nix Flakes](docs/getting-started/installation.md#nix-flakes).

### CLI Flags

Specify provider, model, and starting mode directly:

```bash
# Non-interactive mode with specific provider/model
nanocoder --provider openrouter --model google/gemini-3.1-flash run "analyze src/app.ts"

# Interactive mode starting with specific provider
nanocoder --provider ollama --model llama3.1

# Flags can appear before or after 'run' command
nanocoder run --provider openrouter "refactor database module"

# Boot directly into a development mode (normal, auto-accept, yolo, plan)
nanocoder --mode yolo
nanocoder --mode plan run "audit the auth module"
```

## Why a collective

Nanocoder is built by the Nano Collective rather than a company, and that shapes the tool itself. There are no paid tiers, no telemetry quietly shipping your prompts somewhere, and no roadmap steered by what monetises best — the people building it are the people using it. Building in the open as a collective means the harness stays multi-provider on principle: you are never locked to one vendor's model, and the conventions, tests, and release standards are shared across every Nano Collective project so the work stays legible and contributable.

It is also bigger than one tool. The collective is assembling an open ecosystem of AI tooling — see the [other projects](https://nanocollective.org) — and contributors who show up now help shape what that becomes.
